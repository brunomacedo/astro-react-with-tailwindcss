This is a modern Astro starter template powered by [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), with [Prettier](https://prettier.io) included for consistent code formatting.

Astro comes with Tailwind support out of the box. This template showcases how to build and style your Astro project using React components and TailwindCSS utility classes.

For complete setup instructions, please refer to the [Tailwind Integration Guide](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/).
